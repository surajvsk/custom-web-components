## Introduction

Web components consist of three main technologies:
- **Custom Elements**: Define new HTML elements.
- **Shadow DOM**: Encapsulate the internal structure of the component, ensuring it is isolated from the rest of the document.
- **HTML Templates**: Define chunks of markup that can be reused multiple times.

This repository includes a practical example of creating custom web components by defining a simple web page layout with a header, menu, main content area, and footer.
